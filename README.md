> **Automated CI/CD pipeline for building, pushing, and deploying Docker images using GitLab and GitHub Actions.**

---

## ‚ú® Features

- üîÑ **Automatic Docker image build** on every push
- üè∑Ô∏è **Auto-incremented tags** for each pipeline (e.g., `dev_1`, `dev_2`, ...)
- üì¶ **Pushes images to GitLab Container Registry**
- üö¢ **Updates Docker Swarm service** on your server
- üîí **Secure, fully automated workflow**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **build_and_push**: Builds the Docker image and pushes it to the GitLab Container Registry.
2. **update**: Updates the Docker Swarm service on your server with the new image.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Variables in `.gitlab-ci.yml`

- `SERVICE_NAME`: Name of the Docker Swarm service to update
- `CI_PIPELINE_IID`: Auto-incremented unique number for each pipeline (used for tagging)
- `CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE`, `CI_REGISTRY_USER`, `CI_JOB_TOKEN`: Provided by GitLab
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`, `DEPLOY_USER`, `DEPLOY_SERVER`: Set as CI/CD variables for server access

## üöß GitHub Actions Integration

This project can also be integrated with GitHub Actions for code synchronization or additional automation. Example badge:

- **How it works:**
  - On every push to `main`, GitHub Actions can push your code to GitLab, triggering the GitLab CI/CD pipeline.
  - You can add more badges for linting, tests, or deployment as needed.

---

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Set required variables in GitLab CI/CD > Settings > Variables:**
   - `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`, `DEPLOY_USER`, `DEPLOY_SERVER`
2. **Ensure `.gitlab-ci.yml` is in your project root.**
3. **Push your code!**
   - Every push triggers the pipeline, builds the image, and updates your service.

---

## ‚ùì FAQ

- **Why are tags auto-incremented?**
  - Each pipeline gets a unique tag, so images never conflict and old versions are preserved.
- **Are old images deleted?**
  - No, old tags remain in the GitLab Container Registry.
- **Which image is used on the server?**
  - The latest tagged image is always deployed.
